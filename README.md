# java-bytecode-playground

A playground project about Java Bytecode runtime manipulation. For study purposes only.

### Examples

#### Profiling method execution

This project has an annotation ```@Profiling``` that must be applied on methods. When annotate a method with ```@Profiling```, this library will measure the execution time of the annotated method by just getting the current milliseconds at the begining of the method, and getting the current milliseconds at the end of method and then calculates the difference beetwen initial milliseconds and final milliseconds. The result will be printed in console.

Ex.:

```java
    public class Foo {
        
        @Profiling public void bar() throws InterruptedException {
            // Do some heavy operation
            Thread.sleep(10000);
        }
    
    }
```

### How to run?

1- Compile the project and generate jar file:

```./gradlew clean assemble```

2- Compile your Java source file with the generated jar in classpath:

```javac -cp /path/to/jar YourClass.java```

3- Run the generated bytecode with the generated jar as a javaanget:

``` java -javaagent:/path/to/jar YourClass```
